Animated resolution of basic heat equation

Use run.py to see the static resolution and add objects, use garder and then use run2.py to see the temporal solution to the saved configuration. To erase previous configuration delete the saved_state.txt file. THe resolution to the EDP are on the In_Terface_Stationary and In_Terface_Temporal, the rest is mostly just the animation
